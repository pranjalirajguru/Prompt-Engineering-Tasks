# ðŸ“˜ SkillCraft Internship â€“ Prompt Engineering  

This repository contains the **four tasks** I completed during my **SkillCraft Internship** in Prompt Engineering.  
Each task explores different aspects of prompt design, creativity, automation, and simulation, documented in PDF format.  

## ðŸ“‚ Tasks Overview  

### âœ… Task 01 â€“ Writing Better Prompts  
Learned the basics of prompt engineering by experimenting with **clarity, specificity, and tone**.  
Rewrote vague prompts into improved versions and analyzed how prompt design impacts LLM behavior.  

### âœ… Task 02 â€“ Prompting for Creativity  
Explored how **structure, tone, and examples** influence creative tasks.  
Designed prompts that generate creative outputs (e.g., startup ideas, stories, ad copy) and compared results for **tone, creativity, and detail**.  

### âœ… Task 03 â€“ Prompting for Task Automation  
Applied prompting to **semi-automate real-world tasks** such as summarization, data extraction, and format transformation.  
Created prompts with multiple input-output examples and reflections on **prompt iteration and debugging**.  

### âœ… Task 04 â€“ Simulating an Assistant  
Built a simple assistant by chaining multiple prompts to simulate **dialogue and persona-driven interaction** (e.g., tutor, job interview bot, customer support).  
Documented assistant flows, conversation logs, and improvements for consistent responses.  

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective  
To gain **practical, hands-on experience** in Prompt Engineering through structured tasks provided by SkillCraft.  

## ðŸš€ How to Use  
1. Browse the repository to access task PDFs.  
2. Open each file to explore task details and solutions.  
3. Use as reference for prompt engineering concepts and applications.
